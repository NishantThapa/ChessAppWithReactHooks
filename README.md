See [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for updates.

## How does it work?

-   The game state and the game view are separated.
-   The view re-renders as the state changes.
-   Projections are used to validate whether a move is legal or not.
-   Vectors are used to translate the position of the pieces.

## Setup

You know the drill. `npm i` and all that :)
